My name is Matilda Housley. 

I followed my diagram pretty much completely besides moving isGameLost() from executioner to guesser as guesser had the 
myNumGuessLeft field and the field myDisplayWord from HangmanGame to executioner as it required the secret word. I also 
added print methods to hide data from each class, which was not in my original diagram.
